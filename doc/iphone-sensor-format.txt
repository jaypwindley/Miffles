GPS,<time>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<altitude>,<hor-accuracy>,<vert-accuracy>,<course>,<speed>
COMPASS,<time>,<true-hdg>,<mag-hdg>,<hdg-accuracy>,<x-val>,<y-val>,<z-val>
ACCEL,<time>,<x-val>,<y-val>,<z-val>
GYRO,<time>,<x-val>,<y-val>,<z-val>

GPS and COMPASS use one time base, ACCEL and GYRO use a different time base.  Both are in units of decimal seconds, but have a different origin.

GPS accuracy is in meters.  Course is in decimal degrees, speed in meters per second; negative values indicate invalid sensor data.

COMPASS true heading is derived from magnetic heading, so accuracy (in degrees) applies to both.  Raw XYZ magnetometer data is in microteslas normalized [-128,128] to indicate deflection from relevant magnetic field line.

Inertial reference frame is RH coordinate system with +X to the right, +Y up, and +Z extending out from the touchscreen.

ACCEL units are in Gs.  Readings include gravity acceleration.

GYRO units are Euler rates in radians per second.
